# Soccer Bot 2.0

This is an implementation of a Telegram-bot that simulates results of soccer matches. It takes the EA FC24 attributes of two teams to randomly generate a score of a potential match between them.

The mathematical models that are used in this project are not backed up by any theory and are rough approximations that seem to make sense.

In order to use the simulator you can either run the client.py program on your computer or go to @NewSoccerBot in Telegram, start the bot using the /start command, and follow further instructions.
