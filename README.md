# Soccer Bot 2.0

This is an implementation of a Telegram-bot that simulates results of soccer matches. It takes the EAFC24 attributes of two teams to randomly generate a score of a potential match between them. The mathematical models used to generate random variabales and calculate probabilities are not backed up by any theory and are rough approximations that seem to make sense. Looking forward, I hope to find a way to optimize the parameters of my model or maybe find a different one which will suit the problem better.

In order to use the simulator you can either run the client.py program on your computer or go to @NewSoccerBot in Telegram, start the bot using the /start command, and follow further instructions.
